# bank-of-react
This project is a bank app, users can navigate to different views using the navbar at the top of the screen, for this project only credit and debit are implemented. Clicking on either shows the credit and debit history with the description, amount, and date of each transaction. There is a form that allows users to add credits or debits to the account and it displays properly across pages and the balance gets updated as well.
